This repository contains the SQL schema and data manipulation scripts for a relational database designed to manage and analyze the budget and functional data of the Physics Undergraduate Lab at UC Berkeley. The project utilizes MySQL for database operations, employs the Seaborn library for data visualization through scatter plots, and applies NumPy for correlation analysis. The database assists in aligning projects with appropriate budget timelines and provides analytical insights for better resource management and decision-making.
